    Ah, so you've chosen the path of the source snooper.  
    You've unlocked a hidden side quest: "Inspect Element: Pooper's Gambit."  

    Legend has it that deep within these lines of code lies the answer 
    to the greatest mystery of our time: 
    why dogs only poop right when you're speedrunning late.  

    But beware… for every tag you open, another pile respawns.  
    Our ancestors once wrote in these comments, passing down 
    ancient loot drops: the Shovel of Destiny (+5 Durability), 
    the Bag of Holding That Never Tears, and the 
    Gate Key That's Always Locked (Requires Level 99 Patience).  

    Some say that if you keep scrolling long enough, 
    you'll encounter the Final Boss: the Infinite Pile — 
    a glitchy loop of 💩 so powerful it once soft-locked Internet Explorer.  

    So snoop wisely, Player One.  
    Because while you grind XP here in the code,  
    we're out there… IRL… knee-deep in side quests.
