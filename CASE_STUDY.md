## Short Description

A Jacksonville dog waste removal service needed a complete platform to run their subscription business online. We built a mobile-friendly website with simple booking that turns first-time visitors into paying subscribers in minutes. Customers manage everything from their phone while the owner tracks sales and schedules from a built-in business dashboard.

## Web Design & Development

### Current State

The site handles everything a local service business needs to operate. Customers visiting the website can browse service options for their neighborhood, check if their zip code is covered, and sign up for weekly or bi-weekly service—all without a phone call. The booking process collects important details like gate codes and dog names so the crew shows up prepared.

Once signed up, customers have their own login where they see their service schedule, manage their subscription, and update their information. On the business side, the owner gets a complete view of all customers, upcoming visits, monthly revenue, and new quote requests. Service areas can be expanded with a few clicks as the business grows into new Jacksonville neighborhoods.

The site works perfectly on phones since most customers are browsing from their backyard when they realize they need help. Payments happen automatically each month, and customers can pause or cancel anytime through their account—no awkward phone calls required.

### Intended Future

Upcoming improvements will give customers photo proof after each visit and text message reminders before service days. The business dashboard will add route optimization so the crew wastes less time driving between stops. A referral program is planned to reward customers who recommend the service to neighbors, along with automated review requests to build the company's reputation on Google.

## Challenges & Obstacles

**Getting customers from curious to committed:** People browsing local service websites often leave without booking because the process feels complicated or they're not sure they're in the service area. Every extra question or confusing step means lost customers.

**Handling the money side reliably:** A subscription business lives or dies on billing working correctly every month. Tracking who paid, who canceled, and who needs a reminder had to be bulletproof. Small businesses can't afford payment errors or missed charges.

**Making it simple enough to run solo:** The business owner can't spend hours per day managing a complicated system. Between servicing yards and answering phones, they need to check the schedule, see new signups, and track revenue in under five minutes.

**Mobile experience matters more than desktop:** Most customers make buying decisions from their phone while standing in the yard with their dog. If the site is clunky on mobile or the signup process doesn't work smoothly on a small screen, they'll give up and call a competitor.

**Service areas keep expanding:** As the business grows, new Jacksonville neighborhoods get added to the coverage map. Manually tracking which zip codes are active and turning away customers from areas not yet served had to be flexible and easy to update.

## Solutions Implemented

**Streamlined booking flow:** We built a step-by-step signup process that asks one question at a time so it never feels overwhelming. The system checks the customer's zip code immediately and only shows pricing for service plans available in their area. If they're outside the coverage zone, they can join a waitlist instead of just getting rejected.

**Automated payment system:** All billing runs through Stripe, which handles the heavy lifting of charging cards, sending receipts, and managing subscriptions. When a customer signs up, their payment processes immediately, and the system automatically charges them every month. The business owner never touches credit card numbers or worries about security compliance.

**Built-in business dashboard:** The owner logs into an admin view that shows today's visits, total monthly revenue, and a list of every customer with their contact info and subscription status. Finding a customer's gate code or checking when they signed up takes seconds. New quote requests from the website appear immediately so the owner can follow up while the lead is hot.

**Mobile-first design:** Every page adapts perfectly to phone screens with big, easy-to-tap buttons and forms designed for thumbs. The booking process works smoothly on a phone screen, and customers can log in from anywhere to manage their account—no need to wait until they're at a computer.

**Flexible service area management:** Adding a new neighborhood to the coverage map takes one click in the admin dashboard. When customers enter a zip code during signup, the system instantly checks if service is available there or puts them on a waitlist for future expansion. As the business grows across Jacksonville, the website keeps up without needing a developer.
