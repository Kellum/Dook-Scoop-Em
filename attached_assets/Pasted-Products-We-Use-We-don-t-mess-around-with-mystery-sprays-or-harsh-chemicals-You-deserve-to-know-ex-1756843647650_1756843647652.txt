Products We Use

We don’t mess around with mystery sprays or harsh chemicals. You deserve to know exactly what’s being used in your yard — and more importantly, what your pets are walking (and rolling, and sniffing) through. Everything we use is eco-friendly, pet-safe, and already included in your price. No upsells, no “sanitizer add-on,” just peace of mind baked in.

KennelSol – The Gold Standard in Clean

Veterinary-Grade Safety
KennelSol is the same EPA-approved disinfectant trusted by veterinarians, shelters, and boarding facilities across the country. It wipes out bacteria, viruses, and odors without harming pets, lawns, or local wildlife. Basically, it’s the Lysol of the dog world — minus the harsh fumes and scary warning labels.

Tool & Equipment Sanitizer
We don’t just use KennelSol in your yard — we also soak down our scooping tools, boots, and gear between every job. That means when we show up, we’re starting fresh. No germs hitchhiking from one yard to the next. Your neighbor’s problems stay your neighbor’s problems.

Powerful Yet Safe
KennelSol delivers hospital-level disinfecting power, but it’s non-irritating for pets and people. Tough on germs, gentle on paws — like a bouncer in fuzzy slippers.

Simple Green Outdoor Pet – Eco-Friendly Fresh

Biodegradable & Safe
This formula is designed for outdoor use around pets, kids, and plants. It’s non-toxic, biodegradable, and won’t harm your grass. The only thing it kills is bad smells.

Odor Neutralizer
Instead of just masking smells with fake “spring meadow” perfume, Simple Green breaks down odors at the source. Your yard smells fresh, not like a candle shop explosion.

Environmentally Responsible
Safe for runoff, waterways, and local wildlife. When we clean, the First Coast stays green. The dolphins approve.

Why We Share This

Transparency: Most scoop companies won’t tell you what’s in the bottle. We do. Because “mystery solution” doesn’t sound reassuring.

Pet Safety: If it’s not safe for dogs, cats, and kids, it doesn’t make the cut. Fido can sniff, lick, and roll worry-free.

All-Included: Both KennelSol and Simple Green are part of every service. We don’t nickel-and-dime with “add-on deodorizer fees.” That’s just stinky business.

Better Than DIY: These aren’t dollar-store sprays. These are professional-grade products that actually work.

How We Keep Yards (and Pets) Safe

Scoop It
Heavy-duty tools take care of every pile.

Sanitize It
KennelSol eliminates bacteria and viruses at the molecular level.

Deodorize It
Simple Green neutralizes odors while staying safe for paws, lawns, and kids.

Reset & Refresh
Before heading to the next stop, we clean and disinfect all our tools with KennelSol so every yard starts with a clean slate. (Think of it as hitting the “reset” button — but for poop gear.)

The Bottom Line

Your pets deserve better than mystery chemicals, and your lawn deserves more than a quick scoop-and-go. We use professional, pet-safe, eco-friendly products trusted by veterinarians and pet care pros. And it’s all included in your price. No gimmicks. No add-ons. Just safe, clean yards — with a little humor on the side.
