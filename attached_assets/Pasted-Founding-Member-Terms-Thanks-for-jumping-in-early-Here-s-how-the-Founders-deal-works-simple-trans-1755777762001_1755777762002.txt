Founding Member Terms

Thanks for jumping in early! Here’s how the Founders deal works—simple, transparent, and built to reward early supporters.

Founders Rate — $85/month for 12 months
Your price is locked for your first year of service. After 12 months, standard pricing applies.

“First Month Free” (as a credit after 3 months)
You’ll pay your normal monthly invoice, and after 3 consecutive months of active service, we apply a credit equal to one month on your 4th month’s invoice.
If you cancel before completing 3 months, the credit is forfeited.

Standard Pricing (for comparison)
Typical monthly rate is $100/month (about $23.08 per visit with weekly service at ~4.33 visits/month).
Founders pay $85/month (about $19.62 per visit) during the 12-month Founders period.

Additional Dogs
Add $5 per dog per visit.

Sanitization Add-On
Founders get sanitization included at no extra charge during the Founders period.
(Non-Founders: sanitization is a paid add-on.)

Waste Haul-Away
We always haul waste away at no extra fee. No leaving bags in your bin, no surprise charges.

Billing & Cancellation
Billing is monthly. Cancellations take effect at the next billing cycle.
Cancelling before 3 consecutive months voids the “first month free” credit.

Service Frequency & Scheduling
Pricing assumes weekly service. We offer priority scheduling to Founders and early access as we open new zip codes.

Service Area (Launch)
We’re starting in Yulee, Fernandina, and North Jacksonville. New zip codes will open in waves; Founders get first dibs.

Small print, big clarity: we keep it fair, and we keep it clean—literally.
