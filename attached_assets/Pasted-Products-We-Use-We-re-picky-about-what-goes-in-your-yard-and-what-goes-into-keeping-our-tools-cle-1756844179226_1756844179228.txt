Products We Use

We’re picky about what goes in your yard — and what goes into keeping our tools clean. That’s why we use professional-grade products that are pet-safe, eco-friendly, and trusted in the animal care world. Best of all? It’s all included in your service price. No sneaky add-ons, no “extra sanitizer” fees.

On Stage: Simple Green Outdoor Pet

This is the product your yard sees.

Eco-Friendly & Biodegradable
Safe for pets, kids, lawns, and local wildlife. It breaks down naturally without leaving harmful residues.

Odor Neutralizer
It doesn’t just cover smells — it breaks down odor-causing compounds at the source. Your yard smells fresh, not perfumed.

Designed for Pets
Specifically made for outdoor pet areas. If your dog sniffs, licks, or rolls in the grass (and let’s be honest, they will), it’s safe.

Backstage: KennelSol

This is what keeps our gear spotless between jobs. What we sanitize our tools with.

Kennel-Grade Sanitation
The same disinfectant trusted in veterinary clinics, kennels, and shelters. It destroys bacteria, viruses, and other germs that could spread between yards.

How We Use It
We don’t spray KennelSol in your yard. We use it to sanitize our scoops, boots, and equipment after every job so we arrive clean at the next. Translation: your yard stays yours, and your neighbor’s germs stay theirs.

Safe When Used Right
EPA-approved and formulated for environments where pets live and play. Powerful against germs, but safe for paws once our tools are refreshed and ready.

Why It Matters

Pet-Safe & Family-Friendly
Everything we use is chosen to protect pets, kids, and lawns.

Eco-Responsible
Our in-yard product (Simple Green) is biodegradable and safe for the environment.

All Included
You don’t pay extra for the “good stuff.” It’s standard in every visit.

Full Transparency
We tell you what we use because trust shouldn’t be a mystery.

The Bottom Line

Simple Green keeps your yard safe, fresh, and eco-friendly. KennelSol keeps our tools clean and disinfected between every visit. Together, it means a yard that’s not just poop-free, but safe, sanitary, and paw-approved — with no extra fees or gimmicks.
