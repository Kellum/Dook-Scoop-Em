Dook Scoop ’Em Subscription + Billing Architecture
1. Core Model

Business = mostly subscription-based (recurring cleanings).

Variability comes from:

Service frequency (weekly, biweekly, twice-weekly).

Number of dogs.

(Optional) Yard size.

Philosophy:
All-inclusive pricing. Competitors nickel-and-dime (trash haul, deodorizer), but Dook Scoop ’Em includes it in base rates.

2. Base Plans

weekly

biweekly

twice_weekly

(Optional) pause_hold — customer can pay to retain spot during vacation.

3. Feature Modifiers

dogs → integer (1, 2, 3…).

extra_dog uplift = +$20/mo per additional dog.

(Optional) oversize_yard uplift.

4. Price Examples

1 dog, weekly = $110/mo

2 dogs, weekly = $130/mo

1 dog, twice-weekly = $136/mo

Base Price Table (covers 1 dog):

Weekly = $110/mo

Biweekly = $90/mo (example, adjustable)

Twice-weekly = $136/mo

Modifier:

Extra Dog = +$20/mo per dog after the first.

5. One-Off Charges

Initial Cleanup:

Standard = $25

Heavy = $50

One-Time Cleaning (non-subscriber):

Flat price (set as needed).

Plan Changes:

Add/remove dog mid-cycle.

Stripe handles prorations (or not, depending on preference).

8. Flow Examples

Signup (Weekly, 2 dogs):

User selects plan: weekly.

Dog count: 2.

Stripe Subscription = base weekly + 1 × extra_dog uplift.

Clerk Plan = weekly.

Clerk Feature = dogs: 2.

Plan Change (new dog mid-cycle):

Update Clerk feature → dogs: 3.

Stripe subscription item: extra_dog quantity updated to 2.

Proration applied (or deferred).

One-Time Cleanup (new subscriber):

Add one-time invoice item (25 or 50).

On payment success → Clerk feature = initial_cleanup_paid: true.
