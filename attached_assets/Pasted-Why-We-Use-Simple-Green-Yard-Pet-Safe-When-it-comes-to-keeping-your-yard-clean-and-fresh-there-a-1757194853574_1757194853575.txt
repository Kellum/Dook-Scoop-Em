Why We Use Simple Green Yard & Pet Safe

When it comes to keeping your yard clean and fresh, there are a lot of products out there. Some companies lean on chlorine-based sanitizers like Wysiwash. We prefer Simple Green Yard & Pet Safe—and here’s why:

1. Gentle on Grass and Plants

Wysiwash uses chlorine chemistry (calcium hypochlorite). It’s effective in the moment, but heavy or repeated use can stress grass, cause yellowing, or leave salt buildup in soil.

Simple Green Yard & Pet Safe is non-toxic, biodegradable, and designed for direct use on lawns and landscaping. It won’t scorch your turf even with regular use.

2. Purpose-Built for Pets

Wysiwash is an EPA sanitizer originally designed for kennels, pool areas, and hard surfaces—not your everyday backyard.

Simple Green Yard & Pet Safe was developed specifically for pet areas. It targets odor at the source using enzymes and surfactants instead of harsh chlorine.

3. No Harsh Residue

Chlorine breaks down quickly outdoors, but in concentrated doses it can leave behind salts that grass and soil don’t love.

Simple Green breaks down completely and leaves no residue that could irritate paws or damage plants.

4. Odor Control vs. Sanitization

Here’s the truth: no outdoor yard spray will sterilize grass for a week. Wysiwash kills bacteria on contact, but once the chlorine evaporates, it’s gone.

Simple Green focuses on what really matters in a yard: breaking down pet waste smells and keeping the area pleasant, without promising impossible “long-term sanitization.”

5. Safer Application

Wysiwash must be carefully diluted—too strong, and it can bleach surfaces or irritate skin.

Simple Green Yard & Pet Safe is ready-to-use, with no mixing or special gear. That means consistency, safety, and less room for error.

The Bottom Line
We use Simple Green Yard & Pet Safe because it’s:

Safe for your grass, safe for your pets, safe for your family.

Designed for backyards, not just kennels and concrete.

Focused on odor control and freshness—the real pain point in a pet owner’s yard.

Some competitors might hype “sanitizers” without mentioning the trade-offs. We’d rather be transparent: chlorine has its place, but for the average lawn, Simple Green gives better peace of mind and long-term results.
