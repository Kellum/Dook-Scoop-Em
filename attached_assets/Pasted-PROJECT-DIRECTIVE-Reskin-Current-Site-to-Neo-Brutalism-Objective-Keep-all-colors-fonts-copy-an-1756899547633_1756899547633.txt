PROJECT DIRECTIVE — Reskin Current Site to Neo-Brutalism

Objective
Keep all colors, fonts, copy, and layout structure as is. Replace the visual skin with neo-brutalism: bold, raw borders, flat fills, square corners, no gradients or soft shadows. Prioritize accessibility and strong hierarchy.

Global Changes

Remove all border-radius (0 everywhere).

Remove all box-shadows and gradients.

Replace depth with 2–3px solid borders (3–4px for emphasis).

Keep spacing generous, grid-like, and obvious.

Text blocks max width ~65–75ch.

Navigation / Header

Current nav with underline hover → switch to 2px bottom border on hover/active.

Active page link: boxed or underlined with a thicker line.

“Get Quote” button: square, solid border, flat fill. Hover = invert border/fill. Focus = high-contrast outline.

Hero Sections

Replace soft card backgrounds with framed boxes (2–3px border).

Keep headings and CTAs inside these bordered frames.

Hero images (like the pixel dog): sit in a thin border box, no shadow.

Cards & Feature Blocks (About Us, Products, Services)

Current rounded cards → square cards with borders.

No shadows. Flat fill only.

Icons remain, but framed with stroke widths matching border thickness.

Use border weight (e.g., thicker for “highlighted” product/service) instead of color fill to create emphasis.

Forms (Contact, Commercial Quote)

Inputs: square, 2px border, flat fill.

Focus state: thicker border or solid outline ring (3px in brand accent).

Buttons: square, bordered, flat fill. Hover = invert. Focus = outline.

Pricing Tables (Residential Page)

Each column gets a 2px border. Featured pricing column gets 3–4px border.

Remove subtle shading. Use background fills sparingly.

CTA buttons: square, bordered, flat fill. Hover/Focus same rules as above.

Informational Banners (Poop Emergency, Commercial Status)

Currently pink/red background with soft edges. → Square, 2px border box with solid fill.

Headline stands out through bold type, not rounded styling.

Blog / “Coming Soon” Panels

Current rounded soft box → square bordered panel, flat background.

“Get Started” or “Follow Up” CTAs = bordered buttons.

Footer

Treat footer as a top-bounded box: add a 2px top border.

Keep dark background, but no shadows/gradients.

Links: underline on hover, active link uses border box.

Micro-Interactions

Limit to hovers, focus, and small translate lifts (−2px).

Remove fancy easing or shadows. Use 120–180ms ease-out.

Accessibility

Focus states must be clear: 2–3px solid outline ring (not blur).

All borders meet contrast ratios against their fills.

Acceptance Criteria

All cards, inputs, and CTAs are square and bordered.

No rounded corners or soft shadows remain.

Emphasis achieved via border weight, scale, spacing — not decoration.

Fonts, colors, and copy remain untouched.

Keyboard focus is obvious.

Consistency: all sections use the same border language.
